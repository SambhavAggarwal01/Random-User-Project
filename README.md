# Random-User-Project
A Vanilla JavaScript Application for Creating Profiles of Random People using Random Users API

In this Project the JavaScript Fuctionality is divided into various "Modules" for code maintainability, reusability & reducing redudancy of code. Making use of Modules makes the code efficient to use and debugging the code is easier.

This Application uses the concept of AJAX to fetch the data from the API.

The Application initially automatically loads a Random User Profile. 
Whenever the user Clicks the "Random User" Button, the application loads a Random User Profile.
When the profile loads there are various buttons which display the particular information about the random person, like Name, Email, Age, Address, etc. The Image of the user is automatically displayed.
